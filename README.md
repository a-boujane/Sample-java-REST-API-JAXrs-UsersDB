# RESTJAXrsUsersDB
This is a simple lightweight RESTful web service that uses the following frameworks/technologies:

JAX-rs, 
Jersey (as a Servlet/Framework for JAX-rs),
Jackson (for JSON support),
JAXB (for XML/JSON binding),
Morphia (for the MongoDB connection)

It implements CRUD operations to interact with a nosql db (MongoDB in this case)

Create = POST,
Read = GET,
Update = PUT,
Delete = DELETE,

Tested using Advanced REST client (available in GoogleChrome store for free)

Feel free to fork!
